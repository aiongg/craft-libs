# Craft Keymap

`craft-keymap` holds the data and logic for keyboard bindings in the Craft apps: chords and their
text forms, bindings from chords to commands, scopes, conflicts, user overrides, and an import
pipeline for other applications' shortcut sets. Each application supplies its command catalog,
its file-format readers and its UI.

## Boundaries

- Data and logic only. The apps keep the command catalog (ids, labels, menu paths, defaults),
  the readers for other applications' files, the shortcut editor UI and running the commands.
- Never crashes: no panics, no `unsafe`. Loading settings never fails; what cannot be used is
  kept or reported (`Keymap::problems`, the import report).
- Hostile input is capped: commands, bindings per command, text lengths, import entries, keys,
  path segments and fuzzy suggestions (the `MAX_*` constants). What is cut is counted.
- Reserved chords are opt-in. A keymap reserves no chord unless the app passes a list to
  `Keymap::with_reserved`, e.g. `reserved::system(platform)` for the operating system's window
  switching and closing chords. A reserved chord cannot be assigned or bound.
- Dependencies: `serde` and `serde_json`; `egui` with the `egui` feature.

## A catalog and dispatch

A command with parameters has the key `window.panel {"panel":"layers"}` in settings and reports.
Tools of one group share a key and cycle. A binding can name a scope other than the command's
home scope.

```rust
use craft_keymap::{Active, Bindable, Binding, Chord, CommandRef, Keymap, Kind, Lookup, Platform, Scope, Scopes};
use serde_json::json;

let key = |text: &str| Binding::parse(text).unwrap();
let layers = CommandRef::with_params("window.panel", json!({"panel": "layers"}));
let select = Kind::Tool { group: Some("select".into()) };
let catalog = vec![
    Bindable::new("file.save", "Save", Scope::app()).with_path(vec!["File".into(), "Save".into()]).with_default(key("Cmd+S")),
    Bindable::new(layers.clone(), "Layers", Scope::app()).with_path(vec!["Window".into(), "Layers".into()]).with_default(key("F7")),
    Bindable::new("tool.marquee", "Marquee Tool", Scope::app()).with_kind(select.clone()).with_default(key("M")),
    Bindable::new("tool.ellipse", "Elliptical Marquee Tool", Scope::app()).with_kind(select).with_default(key("M")),
    // Home scope: the Timeline panel, where it wins over the app's L.
    Bindable::new("timeline.loop", "Loop", Scope::new("Timeline").unwrap()).with_default(key("L")),
    Bindable::new("layer.lock", "Lock Layer", Scope::app()).with_default(key("L")),
    // An app command whose binding works only in the Text context.
    Bindable::new("type.bold", "Bold", Scope::app()).with_default(key("Text: Cmd+B")),
];
let keymap = Keymap::new(catalog, Scopes::new().with_panel("Timeline").with_context("Text"), Platform::Mac);

// Dispatch: the chord pressed, whether it is a double press, and what has the keyboard.
let press = |text: &str, active: &Active| keymap.lookup(&Chord::parse(text).unwrap(), false, active);
assert_eq!(press("F7", &Active::NONE), Lookup::Run(layers));
assert_eq!(press("L", &Active::panel("Timeline")), Lookup::Run("timeline.loop".into()));
assert_eq!(press("L", &Active::NONE), Lookup::Run("layer.lock".into()));
assert_eq!(press("M", &Active::NONE), Lookup::Cycle(vec!["tool.marquee".into(), "tool.ellipse".into()]));
let editing = Active { contexts: &["Text"], typing: true, ..Active::NONE };
assert_eq!(press("Cmd+B", &editing), Lookup::Run("type.bold".into()));
assert_eq!(press("M", &editing), Lookup::None, "plain keys go to the text field");
```

While a text field has the keyboard (`Active::typing`), the keymap's `TypingRule` decides which
app and panel bindings wait: plain keys (the default), everything without the command modifier,
or everything. Under every rule, the platform's text-editing chords (`text_editing_chords`) go
to the field too: undo and redo, select all, and moving and deleting by word, line and text
(Cmd+Z, Alt+Left and Cmd+Backspace on macOS; Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Home
elsewhere). Other command chords, such as Cmd+S, still fire. Bindings in an active context
always fire, so `Text: Cmd+B` works while typing, and a `Text: Cmd+Z` binding takes undo from
the field.

With the `egui` feature, `egui::Dispatcher` does this for a frame's key events (see Features).

## Chords

A [`Chord`](src/chord.rs) is a key plus the modifiers `cmd`, `ctrl`, `alt` and `shift`. `cmd` is
the command modifier: ⌘ on macOS, Ctrl on Windows and Linux. `ctrl` is the Mac Control key; off
macOS it folds into `cmd` (`Chord::effective`).

- Canonical text, as stored and sent: `Cmd+Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K`, `Cmd++` for Plus, `A A` for a
  double press.
- `Chord::parse` also reads common aliases (`⇧⌘Z`, `opt+left`, `Ctrl+Cmd+M`).
- `Chord::display(Platform)` gives `⇧⌘Z` on macOS and `Ctrl+Shift+Z` elsewhere.
- `chord::foreign::read_foreign` reads key text written by other applications (Windows or Mac
  modifier names, numeric keypad keys).

## Keyboard layouts

[`layout`](src/layout.rs) decides which chord a key press means, the same way for matching
(`Layout::candidates`), the shortcut recorder (`Layout::resolve`) and labels
(`Chord::display_for`):

1. Letters A–Z: the layout's Latin letter for the key. On a layout that is not Latin (Russian,
   Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Thai), the key's position; on a Latin layout (Dvorak, AZERTY), the
   letter typed. Arabic Ctrl+Shift+D is Ctrl+Shift+D, not the `]` it types.
2. Digits: the digit typed, else the key's position (AZERTY's `&é"` row). A digit-row key that
   types punctuation also matches its digit when the punctuation has no binding.
3. Punctuation: the character typed, without Shift when the layout needs Shift for it: German
   `/` is ⇧7, so ⇧⌘7 runs ⌘/.
4. Whether a layout is Latin is decided for the layout, not per key.
5. With Shift held on a Latin layout, a press that egui reports as the letter at its own
   position, because the character typed has no key (Dvorak's ⇧, types `<`), runs nothing when
   that position has been seen typing something other than its letter: once a `,` has been
   typed, Ctrl+Shift+, never runs Ctrl+Shift+W.
6. Labels show letters and digits by name, and a punctuation key as the character the layout
   types at its position when that character has no key of its own (`Ctrl+Ü` for Ctrl+[ on
   German).

A `KeyInput` holds what the toolkit reports for one press: modifiers, the key typed, the
physical key, and, when the platform reports them, the layout's Latin letter (Windows
virtual-key code, macOS ⌘ table, Linux Latin layout group) and whether Shift was needed. A
`Layout` holds whether the layout is Latin, as the platform reports it or as plain typing shows
it (`Layout::observe`), and the characters it types at punctuation positions.

## Storing overrides

`Overrides` is a field of the app's settings type. It is stored as a map of one text per command
(`{ "file.save": "Cmd+Alt+S", "edit.copy": "" }`, `""` for no shortcut) while no command has more
than one binding, so apps that stored that map before keep reading it in older builds. Once a
command has several bindings it is stored as an array of `{ command, keys }` tables
(`[{ command = "file.save", keys = ["Cmd+Alt+S", "F12"] }]`). Both forms load, and in the map form
a list of texts loads too.

In a craft-settings type, put `#[serde(with = "craft_keymap::keymap::overrides_list")]` on the
field, which always writes the array: craft-settings merges tables key by key with what the file
holds but replaces an array whole, so only the array lets a reset command (an entry removed) stay
removed after saving. Hand-written `[[shortcuts]]` blocks load as the array.

Texts the keymap cannot use (a key name from a newer version, an unknown scope, a reserved chord)
stay in the entry when the command is edited, unless the edit leaves it without bindings.
`Keymap::problems` lists them.

```rust
use craft_keymap::{Binding, Keymap, Overrides, Platform, Policy, Scopes};
use craft_settings::{Location, Settings, SettingsStore};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Default, Clone, PartialEq)]
#[serde(default)]
struct Prefs {
    #[serde(with = "craft_keymap::keymap::overrides_list")]
    shortcuts: Overrides,
}

impl Settings for Prefs {
    const APP_ID: &'static str = "acmecraft";
    const SCHEMA_VERSION: u32 = 1;
}

// `catalog` is the app's Vec<Bindable>.
let (mut store, _report) = SettingsStore::<Prefs>::open(Location::Auto);
let mut keymap = Keymap::new(catalog, Scopes::new(), Platform::current()).with_overrides(store.get().shortcuts.clone());
// Entries for unknown commands and texts that do not parse are kept and listed here.
let _problems = keymap.problems();

// After each change in the shortcut editor:
keymap.set_bindings(&"file.save".into(), vec![Binding::parse("Cmd+Alt+S").unwrap()], Policy::Steal).ok();
store.update(|p| p.shortcuts = keymap.overrides().clone());
```

## Editing

- `set_bindings(&command, bindings, policy)` replaces a command's bindings. An editor with one
  shortcut per command calls it with the one binding (`vec![binding]`); `assign` adds a binding
  to those the command has.
- `remove` takes one binding away, `clear` leaves the command without shortcuts, `reset` gives it
  its defaults back and `reset_all` does so for every command.
- `Policy` says what happens to other commands holding the chord: `Steal` takes it from them,
  `Keep` lets both keep it and reports the clash, `Refuse` changes nothing and returns
  `AssignError::Taken`.
- `conflicts()` lists every pair of commands on one chord; `conflicts_with(&command)` lists the
  commands that share one command's chords, with that command as `a`.

## Importing a shortcut set

The app's reader turns a file (an InDesign Show Set, an Illustrator `.kys`) into an
[`import::ForeignSet`](src/import.rs): entries with a menu, a path and keys read by
`ForeignKey::read`. `import::plan` matches each entry to one command and changes nothing;
`ImportPlan::apply` applies the plan and returns an `ImportReport` (serde, camelCase). Report
rows carry the entry's `item` (its path) and `line`.

```rust
use craft_keymap::{Bindable, Binding, ContextRule, Flavor, ForeignEntry, ForeignKey, ForeignSet, ImportOptions, Keymap, Platform};
use craft_keymap::{Scope, Scopes, plan};

let save = Bindable::new("file.save", "Save", Scope::app())
    .with_path(vec!["File".into(), "Save".into()])
    .with_default(Binding::parse("Cmd+S").unwrap());
let mut keymap = Keymap::new(vec![save], Scopes::new(), Platform::Windows);

let read = |text: &str| ForeignKey::read(Some("Default"), text, Flavor::Windows);
let set = ForeignSet {
    name: Some("My Set".into()),
    entries: vec![
        ForeignEntry::new(Some("File"), ["Save"]).with_key(read("Ctrl+Alt+S")).at_line(12),
        ForeignEntry::new(Some("File"), ["Frobnicate"]).with_key(read("Ctrl+F")).at_line(13),
    ],
};
let options = ImportOptions { contexts: vec![("Default".into(), ContextRule::Home)], ..ImportOptions::default() };
let planned = plan(&set, &keymap, &options);
// A review UI can show planned.commands and planned.report here.
let report = planned.apply(&mut keymap);
assert_eq!(report.changed[0].to, ["Cmd+Alt+S"]);
assert_eq!((report.unmatched[0].item.as_str(), report.unmatched[0].line), ("File > Frobnicate", Some(13)));
```

- Matching, most specific first, each step needing exactly one command: the user's remembered
  answers, the full menu path, the joined submenu segments as a label or alias in that menu, the
  label in that menu, the joined segments as a label or alias anywhere, the label anywhere. An
  entry with no menu and several segments matches only by its full path, unless the reader marks
  it `in_panel_menu()`. Tool entries match only tools.
- Names are compared after `import::normalize_label`: case, `…`, `...`, `&`, colons and extra
  spaces aside, so the alias `Preferences: General…` matches `Edit > Preferences > General...`.
  Aliases (`Bindable::with_alias`) count wherever labels do.
- Panel menus: sources list panel-menu items with the panel's name in front (InDesign's Panel
  Menus area writes `Character: All Caps`; Illustrator and Photoshop sets have similar areas).
  The reader splits the name into segments and marks the entry `ForeignEntry::in_panel_menu()`.
  Such an entry also matches a catalog path that ends with its segments (with the command's
  label or the path's last segment last), and its last segment alone as a label. The last
  segment alone counts only when the first segment, the panel, is a segment of some catalog
  path, so `History: New Document` matches nothing in an app without a History panel. An entry
  without keys that matched only these ways leaves the command's shortcuts alone and is listed
  in `matched_without_change` (reason `PanelMenu`).
- Show/Hide: a source often lists one toggle as two items, `Show Rulers` and `Hide Rulers`. Names
  are matched as written first. When no step finds a command, the steps run again on commands
  marked `Bindable::toggle()`, with a leading `Show `, `Hide ` or `Show/Hide ` dropped from the
  entry's label and from the command's label, aliases and path labels. A command not marked as a
  toggle never matches through a dropped prefix, so `Hide Conveyor` does not match `Conveyor`.
- `ImportOptions.contexts` says what each source context becomes (home scope, another scope, the
  home scope only without a home entry, or skipped).
- The set wins: a chord it gives to a command is taken from commands outside it (except twins
  sharing it as a default), a later entry takes a chord from an earlier one (as when the entries
  are applied in file order; the earlier key is listed in `skipped`), and an entry without keys
  can clear its command. It clears it only when no entry matched to the same command has keys,
  whatever the order of the entries.
- Keys read approximately (a numeric keypad key bound as the main key) are listed in
  `approximated`.
- With `ImportOptions.suggest`, unmatched entries get fuzzy candidates (`import::namematch`);
  they are reported, never applied. Only the first 200 unmatched entries with keys get them, and
  only the first 200 characters of a name are compared. Keys in `ContextRule::Skip` contexts do
  not count: an unmatched entry with only such keys counts in `unmatched_without_shortcut`.

## Features

- `egui`: conversions to and from egui keys and modifiers; `KeyInput::from_egui`;
  `egui::matches`, which accepts the shifted key egui reports for a Shift binding (`Shift+;`
  matches `:`); and `egui::Dispatcher`, which runs a frame's key presses against the keymap,
  reading them by the layout it learns from typing or is given (`with_layout`, `layout()`):

  ```rust,ignore
  let hits = ctx.input_mut(|i| dispatcher.dispatch(i, &keymap, &active));
  for hit in hits {
      app.run(&hit.command);
  }
  ```

  A press that runs a command is removed from egui's events, with the text it typed, so widgets
  do not see it too. Each `Hit` carries the `trigger` that matched and `exact`, which is false
  when the press matched through a stand-in (`:` for `Shift+;`, `+` for `=`).
  `dispatch_filtered` takes a predicate that can decline a hit, for example a chord the native
  menu has already handled: the press and its text then stay in egui's events, in their place.
  While a text field has the keyboard, plain clipboard key presses and presses that typed text in the
  same frame stay with it. That covers AltGr, which a browser on Windows reports as Ctrl+Alt
  followed by the text; a Ctrl+Alt press that types nothing is a command chord.
  `Dispatcher::new().with_repeat(true)` also runs commands on key repeats (held arrows).

  On the desktop, egui-winit sends egui's Copy, Cut and Paste events in place of the key press
  for any chord of Cmd with C, X or V (Ctrl off macOS); the web build sends the press and then
  the event. For the plain chords Cmd+C, Cmd+X and Cmd+V (and Cmd+Insert, Shift+Delete,
  Shift+Insert), the events stay with the app by default, so a binding on those chords runs only
  with `with_clipboard_events(true)`. Then the events count as their chords outside text fields,
  and a Paste event's text moves to `Hit::pasted`. On the web, the press runs the command and
  takes the event, with its text, along. An app whose paste command asks egui for a paste gets a
  Paste event back, which runs that command again; such an app keeps the default. A clipboard
  event with more modifiers held (Cmd+Shift+V, Cmd+Alt+C) always counts as its chord, also while
  typing, and stays when that chord has no binding. egui-winit sends no Paste event when the
  clipboard is empty or holds an image, so a binding on a Cmd+V chord cannot run then on the
  desktop.
